## considered_options
1. Manual SQL migrations  
2. Alembic with CI enforcement  

## decision
Standardize on Alembic migrations executed during deployment.

## rationale
Ensures versioned, repeatable schema evolution.

## consequences
Faulty migrations can block deploys or degrade performance (INC-005).
