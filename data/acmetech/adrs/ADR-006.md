# ADR-006: Kafka Backpressure via Producer Throttling

## context
During traffic spikes, consumers lagged behind, risking unbounded queues.

## considered_options
1. Drop events  
2. Block producers  
3. Adaptive throttling based on lag  

## decision
Throttle producers dynamically based on consumer lag metrics.

## rationale
Preserves data integrity while preventing runaway backlog.

## consequences
Increased end-to-end latency during peak load (INC-006).
