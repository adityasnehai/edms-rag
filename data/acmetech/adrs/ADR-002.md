# ADR-002: Per-Tenant API Rate Limiting Using Redis

## context
Several enterprise customers triggered burst traffic during batch syncs, saturating FastAPI workers
and causing elevated p95 latencies for unrelated tenants.

## considered_options
1. No rate limiting  
   Pros: Zero friction  
   Cons: Platform instability  

2. API Gateway global limits  
   Pros: Easy to configure  
   Cons: Penalizes all tenants  

3. Redis-backed per-tenant token buckets  
   Pros: Fair usage, flexible  
   Cons: Redis dependency  

## decision
Implement Redis-backed per-tenant token bucket rate limiting at the API layer.

## rationale
Allows differentiated limits per enterprise contract while protecting shared infrastructure.

## consequences
Redis eviction or failover can temporarily disable enforcement (INC-002).
