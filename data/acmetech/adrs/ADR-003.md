# ADR-003: Redis Eviction Policy for Shared Caches

## context
Redis is used for workflow metadata caching, API rate limit counters, and idempotency keys.
Memory pressure increased as new features reused the same cluster.

## considered_options
1. Default allkeys-lru  
2. TTL-only keys with no eviction  
3. Separate Redis clusters by use case  

## decision
Use allkeys-lru with mandatory TTLs for rate limits and idempotency keys.

## rationale
Provides bounded memory usage while reducing long-lived stale keys.

## consequences
Under sustained load, critical keys may be evicted, impacting correctness (INC-002).
