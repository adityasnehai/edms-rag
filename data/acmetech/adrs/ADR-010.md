# ADR-010: Kafka Replication Factor Cost Optimization

## context
Kafka storage costs increased significantly in multi-region setups.

## considered_options
1. RF=3 everywhere  
2. RF=2 for non-critical topics  

## decision
Reduce replication factor to 2 for non-critical event topics.

## rationale
Cuts storage cost while accepting limited risk.

## consequences
Higher data loss risk during broker failures (INC-010).
