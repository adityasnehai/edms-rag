# ADR-007: Observability Standardization on Prometheus and Grafana

## context
Each service emitted custom metrics inconsistently, slowing incident response.

## considered_options
1. Logs only  
2. Prometheus + Grafana  
3. SaaS APM  

## decision
Standardize metrics and dashboards using Prometheus and Grafana.

## rationale
Improves visibility while controlling cost.

## consequences
Initial metric gaps delayed detection of some failures (INC-007).
