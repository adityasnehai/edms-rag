# ADR-004: Active-Passive Multi-Region Failover

## context
Expansion into EU-West required regional redundancy to meet enterprise SLAs.
The team lacks operational maturity for multi-writer databases.

## considered_options
1. Active-active regions  
2. Active-passive with DNS failover  

## decision
Adopt active-passive deployment with Route53 health checks.

## rationale
Simpler operational model while still improving availability.

## consequences
Failover introduces 5–10 minute recovery windows (INC-004).
