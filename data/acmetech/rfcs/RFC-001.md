# RFC-001: Platform Enhancement Proposal 1

## Problem Statement
The current platform limits future feature development due to architectural
constraints.

## Proposed Solution
Introduce architectural enhancement 1 to address long-term scalability
and maintainability.

## Alternatives Considered
- Incremental refactoring
- Full platform rewrite
- No action

## Trade-offs
The proposed solution increases short-term development cost but reduces
long-term technical debt.
